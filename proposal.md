## Proposal

### Introduction
Dust storms(DS) have a large impact on natural environment, economy, and human health. PM10 and PM2.5 are the two major factors of DS. 
To learn more about the characteristics of DS and to evaluate model predicting ability of DS, PM10 and PM2.5 of CMAQ output are plotted. I'll look into the relation between PM10 and PM2.5, and further assess the model accuarcy using obeservational data.


### Data
CMAQ (Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling System) output data. CMAQ ingests emissions and meteorology to predict spatial and temporal variations of chemical components such as PM2.5, O3, NO2, and their precursors (Byun and Schere, 2006; Luecken et al., 2019). The model has a 12 km horizontal resolution over the Continental United States (CONUS) region and its surrounding areas. The dimension of this dataset is 24 timesteps x 35 layers x 265 rows x 442 columns.

### Things I might do
1. correlation between PM2.5 and PM10;
2. ratio of PM2.5 and PM10 and how it varies in time;
3. select a specific DS event, compare model data with observatonal data.
4. ...


### Some of the results
