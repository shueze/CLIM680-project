## Who's secretly compromising your health: an Introduction to Particulate Matter (PM) in the US
### <font face="Times New Roman" >Introduction</font>  
Particulate Matter(PM), also known as particle pollution, is a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets in the atmosphere.

Dust storms(DS) have a large impact on natural environment, economy, and human health. PM10 and PM2.5 are the two major factors of DS. To learn more about the characteristics of DS and to evaluate model predicting ability of DS, PM10 and PM2.5 of CMAQ output are plotted. I'll look into the relation between PM10 and PM2.5, and further assess the model accuarcy using obeservational data.  

[Proposal](https://shueze.github.io/CLIM680-project/proposal)   
  
PM10 : inhalable particles, with diameters that are generally 10 micrometers and smaller;  
PM2.5 : fine inhalable particles, with diameters that are generally 2.5 micrometers and smaller.  

EST time zone offset is UTC-05.  
So the first row: evening (5pm to 2am est);  
the second row: morning   (3am to 10am est);  
the third row: afternoon  (11am to 18pm est).

high PM2.5/PM10 value: indicator for PM from local resources;  
low  Pm2.5/PM10 value: indictor for PM from transmission.








This is in line with previous work finding PM2.5 to be about half of PM10, and PM10 being about half of TSP (Wanger and Ganor, 1999).
