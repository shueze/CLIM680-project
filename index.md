### **<font face="Times New Roman" >  Introduction </font>**  

<font face="Times New Roman" >  
Particulate Matter(PM), also known as particle pollution, is a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets in the atmosphere. The most famous PM are PM10(with diameter generally 10mm and smaller) and PM2.5(with diameters generally 2.5mm and smaller). Exposure to PM can pose great risk to our health, causing respiratory and cardiovascular deseases. In this study, we briefly investigate the characteristics of PM distribution and evaluate the model predicting ability of PM by CMAQ(The Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling System), one of the most commonly used air quality models.

### **<font face="Times New Roman" >  Data </font>**  

<font face="Times New Roman" >  
CMAQ (Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling System) output data. CMAQ ingests emissions and meteorology to predict spatial and temporal variations of chemical components such as PM2.5, O3, NO2, and their precursors (Byun and Schere, 2006; Luecken et al., 2019). The model has a 12 km horizontal resolution over the Continental United States (CONUS) region and its surrounding areas. The dimension of this dataset is 24 timesteps x 35 layers x 265 rows x 442 columns.

<font face="Times New Roman" > 
By comparison, we can see that the PM10 level in July is generally higher than the level in January. While the maximum level in July is over 30ug/m3, the level remains below 20ug/m3 in January. Also, in July, the midwest region has the highest level, while in January, high PM10 locate around midwest to southest region, and the west region's PM10 level is rather low.

EST time zone offset is UTC-05.   

So the first row: evening (5pm to 2am est);   
the second row: morning   (3am to 10am est);   
the third row: afternoon  (11am to 18pm est).

high PM2.5/PM10 value: indicator for PM from local resources;  
low  Pm2.5/PM10 value: indictor for PM from transmission.








This is in line with previous work finding PM2.5 to be about half of PM10, and PM10 being about half of TSP (Wanger and Ganor, 1999).
